The Bluethroat Luscinia svecica is a Palearctic passerine comprising several subspecies with distinct migratory strategies. While the movements of L. s. svecica, L. s. cyanecula and L. s. azuricollis are partially known from geolocator and ringing programs, the French Atlantic coast endemic L. s. namnetum has never been tracked. To address this gap, we equipped 31 males with light-level loggers in 2016 and 2017 and 20 males with multi-sensor loggers in 2024 in the core range of the taxon (Charente-Maritime, France). Respectively four and one birds were recaptured the following spring, providing the first full annual cycle tracking for this taxon. The four birds tagged with light level loggers broadly wintered in Western Iberia. The individual tagged with a multi-sensor logger migrated from its breeding site to southwestern Spain in seven flights, leaving in late August, staging for one month at approx. 950m a.s.l in central Spain, and wintering in Andalucía. Spring migration was faster and more direct, with three nocturnal flights in March. All flights occurred at night and reached altitudes up to 4,430 m above terrestrial grounds. These results confirm L. s. namnetum as a short-distance migrant strongly relying on specific Iberian habitats which therefore hold a strong importance in the conservation of this endemic taxon.
